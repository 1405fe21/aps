    <h2>Round-Robin Scheduling for Custom Competitions</h2>

    <div class="description">
        <p>Round-robin scheduling is a technique where tasks or processes are assigned to resources in a circular order, ensuring equitable distribution of resources over time. In the context of custom competitions for organizations on competitive programming websites, round-robin scheduling can be used to schedule competition times fairly among participating teams or individuals.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="explanation">
        <h3>Explanation</h3>
        <p>In competitive programming websites, round-robin scheduling ensures that each participating team or individual gets an equal opportunity to compete. It distributes competition times fairly, preventing any one team from having an unfair advantage due to scheduling biases.</p>
    </div>

    <h3>Space Complexity</h3>
    <p>The space complexity for round-robin scheduling is typically <strong>O(1)</strong>, as it generally requires a fixed amount of memory for maintaining scheduling data structures regardless of the number of teams or participants.</p>

    <h3>Time Complexity</h3>
    <table class="complexities">
        <tr>
            <th>Operation</th>
            <th>Time Complexity</th>
            <th>Description</th>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Scheduling</td>
            <td>O(n)</td>
            <td>Where <em>n</em> is the number of teams or participants. Round-robin scheduling involves iterating over the list of teams or participants and assigning competition slots in a sequential manner.</td>
